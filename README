I now have this code in gitlab...
But this is still very preliminary

There are many paths that are specific to my environment for testing purposes
Many bits of code that are commented out for testing purposes
It's pretty messy, I know, sorry

This version should work if you don't change anything...
Just do git checkout on CUP or your personal PC and run ./multi-chan-fit.py
That should work on both CUP and your personal PC, I hope...
NOTE: if on CUP, it will run in batch mode and not show the plots, but it will
create the plots.
