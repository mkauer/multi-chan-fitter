There are a few paths that are specific to my environment for testing
purposes, and many bits of code that are commented out for testing
purposes. It is still pretty messy, I know, sorry.

This version should work if you don't change anything...
Just do a git checkout on CUP or your personal PC and run "./multi-chan-fit.py"
That should work on both CUP and your personal PC, I hope...
NOTE: if on CUP, it will run in batch mode and not show the plots, but it will
create the plots.
