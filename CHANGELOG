#   the edep cuts
# ~ revamped the sigle/multi hit TCut making in funcs40.py
# + fix for lsveto MC rootfile selection - my code was also selecting
#   lsvetoair rootfiles - this is now fixed - no big impact on anything

# ~ updates the backgrounds2.txt file with PMT K40 activities
# + I have a new joined rootfile with Pushpa's calibs and resols
#   called join22-1544-master.root
# ~ ah, and was forgetting to scale by the dru factor - internal K40
#   looks correct again - now back to work on the pmt scalings...
# ~ shoot, i had mbqkg/kg and that should be mbqkg*kg!!!
# + start working on pmt scaling
# ~ i think the internal scaling should be events/detected
#   which becomes bq * runtime * (1./generated)
# ~ tweaked v21 to plot just data for comparison to v22
# ~ tweaked v22 to use new calibs and resols
# + added join22.py to use new calibs and resols
# ~ tweak join2.py to use a specified mcfile in buildMC2()

# ~ dru1 and dru2 with "reuse" now return the exact same results!
# ~ AH! dru1 fitting fails if the fixed K40 scaling is too high
# + new data in join2-1544-master.root


# 2016-12-12
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ fixed a bug if not using dru1 or dru2 in v20
# + in v14, in func.py I needed to do init mc[loc][iso]['act'] = []
#   and then do mc[loc][iso]["act"].append(-1) for fixed activities


# 2016-12-09
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# + cut a v2.0 release now that the fit rebinning is fixed
# ~ fixed the rebinscale to work with new v20 format but I still
#   don't understand why it effects the fit results so much
# + applied rebin bug fix to v14 and v20
# ~ FINALLY fixed the fit rebinning issue! I was selecting the wrong
#   subset of bins in the HiE filling section. It needs to look like:
#   hist.SetBinContent(n+np, rsigs[key]['hist'].GetBinContent(fHi[0]+r))


# 2016-12-06
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# V 20-global-input-file.py is the new standard
# ~ cleaned up the comments a bit in 20-global-input-file.py
# + cut release v1.1 based off of 14-set-bkg-activity.py
# ~ it's working! v14 vs v20 is basically identical! Woo Hoo!!
# ~ hacked a bunch of stuff in 20-global-input-file.py to get this
#   working - I'm sure there's some bugs yet to fix
# ~ fixed dataDRU2()
# ~ the set bkgs activities are now plotted seperatly
# ~ changed a bunch of stuff in 20-global-input-file.py to allow for
#   the new text list based format


# 2016-12-05
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ applied same fix "range(fLoBins,fbins)" to 20-global-input-file.py
# ~ fixed a bug in 14-set-bkg-activity.py...
#   line 307 should be "range(fLoBins,fbins)" and not
#   "range(fLoBins)" - didn't make much difference in the fitting
#   results? I don't understand that, but a bug none the less.
# + added new dataDRU2() function
# + use funcs2.py with buildMC2(), getData2(), and readROOT2()


# 2016-11-29
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# + scale non dur1/dru2 rebinned errors by the rebinning/sqrt(2)
#   I'm not sure if this is physics right, but it looks about right
#   in the plots. I'll need to check this again...
# + many additions to set the internal K40 activity, it
#   seems to be working? I'm sure I'll find some bugs...
# + set internal k40 as a fixed activity background
# ~ tweaked funcs.py to have mc[loc][iso]['act'] = -1 by default
#   in readROOT()

# 2016-11-28
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# + added y-axis title to resid plots
# - removed legend from resid plots
# ~ changed joined-master.root path to be relative
# + added dru1 histos now have the total mc errors being scaled to dru
# ~ fixed 'fitdata' and 'fitmc' histo filling needs to start at bin 1
#   because bin 0 is the underflow bin - this was a small effect
#   but now it is correct


# 2016-11-23
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ changed variable 'rebin' to 'hiEfitRebin'
# ~ changed variable 'hiErebin' to 'hiEplotRebin'
# + write the fit results to a text file
# - removed/cleaned up a bunch of outdated code and comments


# 2016-11-22
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ scale the total-mc histo error by dru scaling
# + add dru2 which scales the data and mc after the fit
# ~ dru1 scales the data before the fit
# + have to also scale by 1/rebinning factor


# Older Comments - I didn't have dates for these
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# ~ have to use deepcopy when doing mc[E]=deepcopy(mcHi)
# + have to create a seperate mc[E] dict when rebinning
# + add rebinning to the hi-E plots
# + add dru2 which scales the data and mc after the fit
# ~ dru1 scales the data before the fit
# + all data and mc needs seperate dict to preserve memory space
# + the canvas pads need different names to preserve memory space
# ~ fixed some major plotting bugs, nothing physics related,
#   just root plotting maddness
# + dru conversion is working i think...
# + rebinning of the hi-E is working i think...
# ~ I'm probably missing another factor here but it acutally seems
#   that by NOT scaling the rebinned data/mc by 1/rebin, the fit
#   does a better job - I don't understand this yet...
# + scale the data and mc by 1/rebin factor or the lo-E to hi-E scale
#   will bias the higher stats from the rebinned histos
# + I kinda fixed the rebinning bug. still needs more testing...
#   The fit still freaks out sometimes with some rebin factors
#   Not sure why but I need to investigate that more...
# + fixed another big bug with the combined fit histo gap
# + fixed a major bug with the filling of the fit-histos
# ~ let's make the residual show data/MC not data-MC
# + add more lists for total,resid,legs,zeros so they have their
#   own memory space and aren't lost when modifying the canvases
# ~ resolution function should be divided by 2 (see funcs.py)
#   I generated a new joined rootfile with the MC reso / 2
# + added TFractionFitter weight histo but it doesn't work?
#   Still need to work on that. Don't understand why that doesn't work.
# + plot both loE and hiE histos that are scaled from the multi-fit
# + combine loE and hiE histos into 1 histo for fitting
# + need copy.copy or copy.deepcopy when reading histos from rootfile
#   and adding to a list or dict. Going to use deepcopy just to be sure.
# ~ now use buildMC() to get your MC
# ~ all histograms should have a unique key
# ~ fixed hostname selection
# + NOTE: The funcs.py import will only work for 10-mc-fit.py and later!!!
# + I guess importing other personal python modules now works
#   with the cup cluster? It didn't work in the past. Weird.
#   Well okay, now I have a seperate funcs.py to import and it seems
#   to be working with the cup cluster as well.
# ~ big re-write - set mc as mc[loc][iso] - just seems more logical
#   just to be clear - it was mc[iso][loc] - now it's mc[loc][iso]
# ~ fixed a bug with enumerate [iso][loc] j+k thing that doesn't work!!
#   that also effected the mc scaling and plotting...
# + get p-value from fit - doesn't seem right?
# ~ tweaked the plotting cosmetics a bit to make it look better,
#   good grief, what a bitch...
# + put residuals on the same canvas! awesome!
# ~ add options to scale and/or weight the MC
# ~ change plot names if generated on CUP or not
# ~ low energy fit needs to be >= 5keV? not 0keV!
# ~ that was a lot of if-else statements... good grief...
# + option for CUP testing - just 1 root file for testing
# + option for hi/lo energy fitting
# ~ tweak for low energy fit
# ~ fixed mc+data+tot+resid length issue
# + another canvas showing the residuals
# + show the total mc in gray after the fit
# + get hostname and select data path based off hostname
# + try to fit high energy stuff - based off my dm17 fitting code
# ~ tweak legend size to make a little more consistent,
#   but it's still not quite right, i don't know why..
# ~ plot low energy things - ah, use pmtXX.qc5 not qc_5 - oops
# + added low energy calib and resolution functions
# ~ use assumption that res~srqt(E) with intercept=0
# + working on resolution params, but need at least a linear
#   fit to the resolution points to get anything reasonable
# + working on hiE parameters
# + finally got colors to work. What a pain in the ass.
#   The color index can't be too big > 10,000 and you have to
#   save the list of colors and indexes or they get dumped
#   out of memory and then it doesn't work right.
# + urgh... finally got hists into dictionary
#   hist name must be same as hist var-name (don't know why)
# + start adding in external backgrounds too
# ~ use Pushpa's data calibrations - wrong but a start
# ~ just use this as the default so I don't have multiple
#   versions of scripts around
# ~ for some weird reason importing my "funcs.py" doesn't work
#   on the cup cluster? Very weird. So I've put all the extra
#   functions in this script and now it works on CUP. ???
# ~ moved sim stuff to under CUP
# ~ tweaked spacings and labels on the canvas
# + got legends working for the plots
# ~ tweaked the layout to be 4x2 as real layout
# + seperate funcs.py import for extra functions
# + adding in U238 with K40
# + functionized some things in prep for the future fitting
# + ROOT batch settings [0 or 1]
# + canvas as a python list
# + histos as a python list
# + hacking at multi-plot-test.py
# + hacking at plot-test.py
